# Django_Help

fr/en

*This app serves just as a reminder to several basic elements of Django, Django Rest Framework + Vue.js.*

i didn't do it here, but we must have to separate the django folders in a backend folder at the root of the project and the vue.js folders in a frontend folder at the root.

APP1 is an example of django applications.
RestAPP is an example of django rest framework applications with vue.js.

Used :
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Django Cors Header
- Vue.js
