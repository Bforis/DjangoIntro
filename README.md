fr/en

i didn't do it here, but we must have to separate the django folders in a backend folder at the root of the project and the vue.js folders in a frontend folder at the root.

APP1 is an example of django applications.
RestAPP is an example of django rest framework applications with vue.js.

Used :
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Vue.js
